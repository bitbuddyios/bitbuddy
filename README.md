## Support
If you experience any issues in relation to application functionality, try these troubleshooting tips.

**1. Information Not Loading**
   
   If your information isn't loading properly within Bit Buddy, try quitting the app and reopening it.
   
**2. Biometric Authentication**
   
   If biometrics aren't working, go to the Settings pane within the app (toolbar) and uncheck the Biometrics toggle. Once the request goes through, try enabling Biometrics again by repressing the toggle.
   
**3. Secure Wipe**
   
   Secure Wipe works by refreshing the app state whenever the function is called. It is highly recommended the users quit the app once confirming their choice to remove all content. Upon restart of the app, all information will be erased.
   
**4. In-App Purchases**
   
   If your in-app purchase does not remove ads from Bit Buddy, close the app from the multitasking tray in iOS/iPadOS and reopen.

  **5. Other Concerns/Issues**

  If none of the above steps helped with your specific problem, users can contact us at support@bitbuddyapp.co, or use the "Report a Bug" button within the Settings pane of Bit Buddy.
