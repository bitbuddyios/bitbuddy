## Support
If you experience any issues concerning application functionality, try these troubleshooting tips.

**1. Information Not Loading**
   
   If your information isn't loading properly within Bit Buddy, try quitting the app and reopening it.
   
**2. Biometric Authentication**
   
   If biometrics aren't working, go to the Settings pane within the app (toolbar) and uncheck the Biometrics toggle. Once the request goes through, try enabling Biometrics again by repressing the toggle. Bit Buddy does not currently automatically lock when the user leaves the app.

   Bit Buddy uses your device's built-in biometric authentication capabilities (Face-ID/Touch-ID). If you want to disable Bit Buddy from being able to use any biometric data, go to your device's Settings app, scroll to Bit Buddy, and uncheck the toggle labled "Face-ID/Touch-ID."
   
**3. Secure Wipe**
   
   Secure Wipe works by refreshing the app state whenever the function is called. It is highly recommended the users quit the app once confirming their choice to remove all content. Upon restart of the app, all information will be erased.

   Should Bit Buddy be deleted or removed from your device all content will be erased. If you no longer like or need Bit Buddy, we recommend users perform a Secure Wipe prior to deletion to ensure that zero information remains stored on your device.
   
**4. In-App Purchases**
   
   If your in-app purchase does not remove ads from Bit Buddy, close the app from the multitasking tray in iOS/iPadOS and reopen. Upon reopening of Bit Buddy, all third-party advertisements will be removed from their respective views (Home, Settings, App Icon Switcher).

  **5. Device Location**

Bit Buddy allows users to enter an address/location for each device. This location is only used to show the Map view found in the expanded device view (clicking into a saved device). This location information is not made available to Bit Buddy, nor is any information transmitted to Bit Buddy or its developer. Adding an address is optional and users will never be forced to add one.

  **6. Other Concerns/Issues**

  If none of the above steps helped with your specific problem, users can contact us at support@bitbuddyapp.co, or use the "Report a Bug" button within the Settings pane of Bit Buddy. All correspondence from Bit Buddy will come from a domain with '@bitbuddy.co' at the end.
