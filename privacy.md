# Privacy Policy
### Last updated: Feb. 23, 2024 @ 9:43 PM EST.
Thank you for choosing Bit Buddy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience on our app. This privacy policy outlines the various ways Bit Buddy uses and protects your information.

## Overview
Bit Buddy (app) is developed, maintained, and updated by Sparrow Apps, a division of Sparrow Films, based in Delaware, United States. Bit Buddy does not contain any subscription plans or recurring charges. For a small cost, users can elect to remove all third-party advertisements from the app. This cost, outlined in the version of the app in the Apple App Store, is a one-time purchase. Users can always restore their purchase should Bit Buddy be removed from the device. Purchases are linked to the user's (you) Apple ID, and cannot be transferred or shared.

## Personal Information
Information stored within Bit Buddy remains entirely on the user's (you) device. Information is never shared with us, Sparrow Apps, or Apple/App Store. Users are in complete control of the information stored within Bit Buddy. Users always have the option to remove their information, either on an item-by-item basis or by using the built-in "Secure Wipe" function. Deletion of Bit Buddy from your device will also remove all content stored within.

If you experience a crash, Apple may send device-related information to us, Sparrow Apps, to help better understand the cause of the crash, and how to fix it. This information may include the device model, software (iOS/iPadOS) version, app version, the date and time, and the 
action that led to the crash.

## Privacy & Security
Bit Buddy, and the information stored within, live entirely on your device. There is no cloud or third-party storage connection.

Bit Buddy features the use of Biometric Authentication to prevent unauthorized access to your stored information. This Biometric Authentication relies on users being enrolled in Face/Touch-ID on their device. Bit Buddy does not have access to face or fingerprint scans. Users always have the option to revoke Biometric Authentication (labeled as Biometrics from within Bit Buddy) on an app-level or system level. To remove all access to device biometrics, go to the Settings app on your device, scroll to Bit Buddy, and uncheck the toggle marked "Face/Touch-ID."

_**Note: Bit Buddy does not currently lock when users navigate away from the app.**_

## Links
Bit Buddy may contain links to other websites within the Settings pane. Clicking on any of these links will open a third-party link. These websites are not operated by Sparrow Apps or Bit Buddy, and their privacy policies can be extremely different from those of Sparrow Apps/Bit Buddy. It is recommended that users familiarize themselves with the Privacy Policy of these websites.

Bit Buddy features several links that route users to their default mail application. When contacting Sparrow Apps/Bit Buddy, important app-related information such as device model, application version, software (iOS/iPadOS) version, and build number will be shared with Sparrow Apps. The user's email address will also be shared as the primary means of contact. All correspondence from Sparrow Apps/Bit Buddy will come from an email from the email '@bitbuddyapp.co.'

Bit Buddy features links that route users to the Apple App Store. These links, when clicked, open a Review form to allow users to easily leave a review of the current version of Bit Buddy. These reviews are made available to Sparrow Apps/Bit Buddy. Sparrow Apps is not notified when users click on the link from within the Settings panel.

## Changes to this Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated. Users are strongly encouraged to frequently monitor changes made to this policy and the contents of it. The date listed at the top of this Privacy Policy will always show the date this policy has been updated. When applicable, a pop-up may appear within Bit Buddy to alert users of changes.
